So far we've looked at the GET request that a client sends to the server to retrieve data.
Let's move on to the possible responses a server can send.

In sending this GET request, the client wants to retrieve information
about a user with an ID 345, stored in the server's database.
GET https://mimo.com/users/345

What is one of the things a server does when receiving a GET request for a resource?
It checks if it has this resource

Send a GET request to retrieve an item with an ID 776 from the database of an online shop's server.
GET httts://thefrock.com/items/776

One common format for an HTTP response body is JSON, which stands for JavaScript Object Notation.
{
    "username": "mm_36",
    "name": "Mac Miller"
}
