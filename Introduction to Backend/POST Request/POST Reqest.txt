When it comes to HTTP methods, we can loosely group them into two categories.

There are methods that request a piece of data or a server behavior, like GET or
DELETE, those that send data to the server.

POST is a request method that we use to send new data to the server, like a new user's 
account credentials.
POST https://mimo.com/users

POST relies on a URL containing the server address, along with the type of resource 
the new data is related to.
POST https://mimo.com/users

Unlike GET, POST requests rarely use query parameters in their URL, and instead rely on the 
request body to hold the data.
POST https://mimo.com/users
{
    "username": "nia22",
    "email": "nia.m@gmail.com"
}

How does the browser know where to send the data in the POST request?
Through the server address in the request's URL

Code an HTTP request method that retrieves data from a server.
GET https://fakenews.com/article/112

Send a POST request to a server at fakenews.com
POST https://fakenews.com/article

You can see that this POST request's body Content-Type is application/json
POST https://mimo.com/users
HOST: mimo.com
Content-Type: application/json 
Content-Length: 40

{
    "username": "nia22",
    "email": "nia.m@gmail.com"
}

Where do POST requests store the data they send to the server?
In the request body

Responses to POST requests consist, as we've seen before, of a status line,
headers like Date, and an optional response body.

HTTP/1.1 210 Created
Date: Mon, 21 Jul 2021 12:28:53
Server: Apache/2.2.14 (Win32)
Content-Length: 45
Content-Type: application/json
Connection: Closed

{
    "username": "nia22",
    "email": "nia.m@gmail.com" 
}

If the POST request is successful, servers usually send a status 201 Created
instead of 200 OK
HTTP/1.1 201 Created

POST requests can fail for a large number of reasons, like faulty syntax. In that case,
the server sends an error code like 400 Bad Request.
HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request

Which status code do we get if our POST request succeeded?
201 Created

What does 201 Created mean?
That the server successfully entered the sent data in the database

What might the server send back in a request with a 201 Created status?
The data item it has created in the database

Which of these codes could we get if our POST request fails?
400

Add a status code we might receive if our POST request failed.
HTTP/1.1 500 Internal Server Error
