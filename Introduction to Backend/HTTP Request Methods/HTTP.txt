As we've already covered, web browsers communicate with web servers through HTTP.

CLIENT      ->REQUEST         SERVER
              <-RESPONSE  

Every time you use a search engine, make an online purchase or even click a link, the 
browser sends a request to a server.

A request is made of different parts, each with a specific role. The URL specifies the
location of the server and the content or resource.

 GET     https://abc.com     /movies
|---|   |---------------|    |------|
method   backend location    resource

The method of a browser request defines the type of action is should perform.
There are a few different methods that browsers can send.

Which actions might require different methods?
    Creating a new account, deleting an account.

GET is a frequently used method. GET means the browser wants to retrieve a specific 
resource. For example a product description.
GET 
https://coolproducts.com/robots/newrol/4

POST is another common method, which helps us create something new on the backend.
For example, adding a new user to the database.
POST 
https://coolproducts.com/signup/newAccount

Examples of a POST request include creating a new account, writing a new blog post
entry, or uploading a new social media post.
POST https://insta.com/posts/new

DELETE is another common HTTP method that removes someting on the server, like deleting
an account or a post.
DELETE 
https://coolproducts.com/robots/newrol/6
