    <h1>Scope</h1>
    <p>
      <strong>Local</strong> or <strong>function</strong> scope refers to the
      part of code inside a function.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here, <span>country</span> is a local variable that we can access only
      inside of the <span>visitCountry</span> function.
    </p>
    <p>
      The space outside a function is called <strong>global scope</strong>. You
      can think of it as the code between functions.
    </p>
    <p>
      If we declare <span>cityToVisit</span> in the global scope, we can access
      it from outside and also from inside the <span>travel</span> function.
    </p>
    <p>
      The last scope is called <strong>block scope</strong>. It's part of our
      code in between the braces (<span class="braces">{}</span>) that belong to
      loops or conditionals.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span>var</span> variables don't respect block scope, which is why they
      can lead to errors if we declare them more than once.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here, we're changing the value of the <span>access</span> variable
      brecause we're redeclaring it in the conditional. What will be the output?
    </p>
    <p>
      If we define <span>let</span> and <span>const</span> in a block scope, we
      can only access them in that block of code.
    </p>
    <p>Here there are two <span>canDrive</span> variables.</p>
    <p>But we're only displaying one of them, which one?</p>
